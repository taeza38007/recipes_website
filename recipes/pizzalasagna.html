        Ok, so pizza anything is pretty much the perfect meal, especially when kids are involved. 
        So, instead of just straight pizza, I like to find ways to mix it up.

        You can definitely make normal lasagna from this recipe as well. 
        This tomato sauce is so good and goes well with Italian dishes in general. Basically, grab some noodles and roll on dinner. 
        I love a good homemade sauce that works for a lot of recipes, and you can’t go wrong with this one.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cook and drain the Italian sausage. Place into a bowl and set aside. </p></li>
        <li><p>In a large saucepan, bring 6 cups of water to a boil and season generously with salt. Cook the lasagna noodles for 7 minutes or until al dente. Remove from water and cut to size. Prepare the tomato sauce. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tbsp of olive oil. Add the onions and cook until translucent. Stir in the fresh garlic and red crushed pepper and cook until fragrant. Add the crushed tomatoes and remaining ingredients. Cover and cook for 20-25 minutes. </p></li>
        <li><p>In a 9 by 13 by 3-inch baking pan or dish, pour 1 cup of the Tomato Sauce in the bottom and spread to evenly cover the bottom. Layer lasagna noodles on the bottom of the pan, in a single pattern slightly overlapping. Add ½  of the ricotta and spread over the lasagna noodles. Next, add mozzarella slices, leaving 1” between each slice. Then, top with ½ of the sausage, ⅓ of the pepperoni, and ⅓ of the shredded Parmesan. Spoon 1 cup of tomato sauce over the top. Top with lasagna noodles and repeat. Cover the top sheet of lasagna noodles with remaining mozzarella slices, pepperoni, and parmesan. Sprinkle Italian herbs over the top. Bake for 45 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Cut into sections and serve. Enjoy!</p></li>
